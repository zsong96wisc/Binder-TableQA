Here is the pandas DataFrame's dtype with sampled examples of each column's content in the comment.
Each example is seperated by #
```python

[QUESTION]

The python function should be like:
1. A function that takes the DataFrame `df` and return the answer to the Question;
2. Do some processing to each record so that it can retrieve the answer;
3. The name of the function should be `check_statement`.

Here is an example of generated function:
```python
def check_statement(df):
    pass # return True of False
```
