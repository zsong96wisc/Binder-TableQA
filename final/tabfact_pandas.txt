Please generate a Python function given the pandas DataFrame dtype and the Statement.
Here is the pandas DataFrame's dtype with sampled examples of each column's content in the comment.
Each example is seperated by #
```python
>>> import pandas as pd

[DATA_SCHEMA]
```

Statement:
[STATEMENT]

The python function should be like:
1. A function that takes the DataFrame `df` and return True or False to the Statement;
2. Do some processing to each record so that it can judge the Statement;
3. The name of the function should be `check_statement`.

Here is an example of generated function:
```python
def check_statement(df):
    pass # return True of False
```
