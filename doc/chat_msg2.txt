Please generate a Python program given the SQLAlchemy ORM and the Question.
SQLAlchemy ORM schema with examples of each column content in the comment:
```
class Table(Base):
  __tablename__ = "Athelete_Information"

  born_date: Mapped[str] # e.g., "oct 4, 2017", "nov 23, 2018"
  name: Mapped[str] # e.g., "Steven Fox", "Scott Cat"
  country: Mapped[str] # e.g., "Canada", "China"
  weight: Mapped[Optional[str]] # e.g., "66 kg", "59 kg"
  height: Mapped[Optional[float]] # e.g., 183.4, 179.2
```

Question:
Who is the oldest?

The complete python program should contains two steps:
1. A sequence of SQLAlchemy statement `stmt` that can be input into SQLAlchemy's `session.scalars(stmt)` function;
2. A function that takes the returns of `session.scalars(stmt)` and return the answer to the question so it can process each record, which may be difficult to be handled in the first step.
Here is an example of partial python program of that two steps:
# step 1
stmt = select(Table) # Get related columns and necessary processing
results = session.scalars(stmt)

# step 2
def get_answer(results):
  for r in results:
    pass # Processing one row of results
get_answer(results)
