Please generate a Python program given the pandas DataFrame dtype and the Question.
pandas DataFrame dtype with examples of each column's content seperated by # in the comment:
```
>>> df.name = "Athelete Information"
>>> df.dtype
born_date object # e.g., oct 4, 2017#nov 23, 2018
name      object # e.g., Steven Fox#Scott Cat
country   object # e.g., Canada#China
weight    object # e.g., 66 kg#59 kg
height    float64 # e.g., 183.4#179.2
dtype: object
```

Question:
Who is the oldest?

The complete python program should contain:
1. A function that takes the DataFrame `df` and return the answer to the question;
2. Do some processing to each record so that it can return the answer.
