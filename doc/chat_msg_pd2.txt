Please generate a Python program given the pandas DataFrame dtype and the Question.
pandas DataFrame dtype with examples of each column's content seperated by # in the comment:
```
>>> df.name = "List of television stations in Manitoba"
>>> df.dtype
City_of_licence object # e.g., Brandon#Minnedosa
Analog_channel  int64 # e.g., 4#12
Digital_channel int64 # e.g., 13#51
Virtual_channel float64 # e.g., 13.1#35.1
Callsign        object # e.g., CKYB-TV#CHMI-DT
Network         object # e.g., CTV#Global
Notes           object # e.g., MTS TV HD ch. 417
dtype: object
```

Question:
Which network has twice as many stations of network 'Global'?

The complete python program should contain:
1. A function that takes the DataFrame `df` and return the answer to the question;
2. Do some processing to each record so that it can return the answer.
